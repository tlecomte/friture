Friture Changelog
(full changelog can be found in the git repository)

HEAD
+   (levels) remove the bogus factor of 2 on the rms. Now the rms of a sine is
    3dB below its peak, as expected.
+   (delay estimator) Increase the delay smoothing for more reliabilty

Version 0.6 - 2012/06/07
+   (general) Track the number of Xruns. Display it in the about dialog,
    in the statistics tab.
+   (delay estimator) Cross-correlation is time averaged for robustness, better
    significance estimation, and phase info taken from the weighted
    cross-correlation too.
+   (delay estimator) Use generalized cross-correlation computation, with PHAT
    weighting. Now the estimation is much more robust in a reverberating
    environment.
+   (general) Increase sample rate to 48000 Hz. This simplifies and improves the
    quality of the filters in the octave spectrum.
+   (octave spectrum) Fix midband frequencies, so that they match the ISO
    bands of an equalizer

Version 0.5 - 2012/05/26
+   (delay estimator) The maximum reliably-estimated delay is now configurable.    
    Just in case somebody needs more than one second
+    (delay estimator) Replace the peak detection by cross-correlation  
    The cross-correlation is computed on (largely) subsampled data. It
    not only provides the delay, but also the in-phase information,
    and a measure of the correlation quality (value of the normalized
    correlation coefficient).
+    Display the level labels with a 250 ms period.
    This reduces the work that needs to be done (drawing text is
    costly), and makes the values much more readable.

Version 0.4 - 2012/05/18
+    First embryo of documentation
+    Add PyPI requirements.txt file, so that friture dependencies
    be installed by 'pip'
+    New text file for user-readable changelog
+    (generator) Test for zero mean before using it as a denominator
+    (Pink noise generator) Fix the parameter k   
    k, the number of white channels to sum, was dynamic,
    and this was causing changes of colors in the produced noise,
    changes that could be heard.
+    (Generator) Fix exception in pink noise generator.   
    Now returns empty array when asked for n=0 samples
+    (Generator) prevent overflows at -1.   
    Premultiplying by 0.99.
+    (Generator) Bugfix: time array was not incremented properly.
+    Improve english wording of package description.
+    Add comment about folder state before PyPI upload
+    (delay_estimator) Remove unused import and commented out code
+    (delay_estimator) only compute the square once

Version 0.3 - 2012/04/29
+    (delay estimator) also display the delay in meters
+    (py2exe) Exclude more dll from the package
+    Increment version
+    Add version and release date in the about page.
+    Properly delete widgets when closed or changed.
+    (py2exe) do not exclude subprocess    
    subprocess is now required by psutils
+    (py2exe) do not ignore difflib   
    difflib is now required for numpy
+    Do not redraw the delay label if the text has not changed.
+    Disable the linear screen interpolation in timeplot.   
    This was bogus signal-wise, and practically prevented from
    displaying some data correctly.
+    Introduce a variable for the time window in the scope.
+    Remove the minus peak in the burst generator.
+    Remove the bogus time inversion in the scope.
+    Fix message for delay estimator in single channel.
+    Fix detection of peaks in the delay estimator.
+    Add a new widget to measure delays.    
    Detect peaks in two channels and measure the time
    difference between the two.
+    Enlarge the trigger window
    (and remove leftover debug statement)
+    Change scope to trigger on center of window, improve triggering.
+    Fix buffer growth in ringbuffer.py
+    Allow negative times in the scope horizontal axis
+    Fix indentation
+    Immprove the burst generator
    Make the computation cleaner, and double its amplitude.

Windows version 2010/03/12 (no installer, executable not publicly released)

+    Add some excludes to setup.py:py2exe
+    Comment out cochlear code since it is unused for now, and causes
    py2exe to include a lot of scipy, if not all.

First ever Windows executable (not publicly released) 2010/03/11

+    Workaround a bug in scipy imports that appears when using py2exe.
+    Add code for cochlear processing. Not enabled yet, may not
    be the best idea after all.
+    Add a file with an implementation of the gammatone
    filter bank in numpy (currently only half-converted
    from Matlab)
+    Add code for logarithmic scope, not enabled yet.
    A better solution could be to dynamically adjust the scale, using
    the same kind of algorithm as for the peak computations.
+    Finally fix off by one color computation.
+    Ask Qt not to update the canvas background on each paint event.
+    Use astype instead of digitize, which is mush slower because it can do
    so much more. Nest step could be to use a function instead of a
    precomputed palette.

2009/11

+    Small simplificaton in UI layout code
+    Use numpy clip function
+    Add profiling instructions at the top of friture.py
+    Add a script to convert the pstats output to a graphviz dot file, which can
    in turn be converted to a png
+    Replace a boolean mask with a simple substraction
+    Cache the decimation computation to avoid a log2.
+    Replace uses of .max() with [-1] where possible.
+    Do the dB conversion once instead of twice for level widgets
+    Remove a useless sqrt since we do a log10 just after.
+    Cache the canvas object for all plots, since it appears to be a
    slow call in qwt.
+    Add a window icon, currently very basic
+    Simplify peak computation
+    Introduce one more cached array for peak computation
+    Decimate as much as possible before doing the fft
+    Remove log10 usage from peaks computation in the spectrum
+    Just import what is needed in audioproc.py
+    Cache the frequency scale in audioproc
+    Move the spectrum processing to its function.
+    Move scope processing ot its function.
+    Move level processing to its function
+    Remove the use of the status bar to gain screen spece.
    Use the plot picker instead.
+    Move the frequency scale definition to the processing function.
    This is in preparation to the use of decimation to decrease
    computing time for fft of small upper range.
+    Compute the peaks directly on the interpolated spectrum.
    Fewer peaks to compute when the fft size is larger than the number
    of pixels in the plot, which is a common case.
+    Move the computing of peaks to a specific function.
    That way it appears independently in the profile.
+    Use command-lien arguments to select the profiling tool.
    Default to no profiling.
+    Bug fix : stream is in int16 format, not int32 ! This fixes the frequency
    scale factor of 2 that was observed.
+    Use SAMPLING_RATE instead of hardcoded number.
+    Use rfft since the input is real.
+    Cleanup spectrum code.
+    Add basic trigger capability to the scope widget
+    Move the default position for the statistics widget to the left.
+    Replace the settings button with an action in the toolbar.
+    Move settings to a separate dialog. Greatly cleans up the interface !

2009/10

+    Disable antialiasing fro scope and spectrum. Dramatically improves
    the performance !
+    Intelligently (i.e. with interpolation) limit the number of points
    to be drawn on the plot to the canvas width (in pixel units). Avoids
    the spectrum painting time to skyrocket for high fft sizes
+    Add statistics field about spectrogram timer period
+    Change statistics description to be more meaningfull
+    Add timing statistics about computation and display
+    Add file for log2 scale engine
+    Disable plots decimation since it raises issues with the spectrum
    plot and its peaks
+    Add time information for each timer events
+    Factorization of log10
+    SYnc to qsynthmeter.cpp rev 306, adds gradient look
+    Simplify fft size save/restore
+    Fix frequency scale saving
+    Fix the frequencies labels formatting
+    Fix the frequency label formatting
+    Save/restore color ranges
+    Save/restore time range.
+    Save/restore frequencies minimum and maximum
+    Save/restore the frequency scale
+    Save and restore the fft size when closing/starting Friture.
+    Move state save/restore to specific functions
+    Add base 2 logarithmic frequency scale for the spectrogram.
    Warning: the frequency scales drawn on the side of the graph are wrong !
    I am waiting for a bug fix in PyQwt before implementing them.
+    Change the frequency range for the spectrogram too.
+    Add two spinBoxes for frequency range selection. Only works for the spectrum
    for now.
+    Uncheck actionStart when changing input device
+    Major timer redesign.
    Now we have two timers: one for 1D and 2D widgets (levels, scope, spectrum,
    statistics), and one for 3D widgets (spectrogram). Using an audio buffer
    avoids latency issues. This audio buffer behaves like the spectrogram pixmap.
    It is a circular buffer, with data written twice.
+    Add statistics about FFT period.
+    Log to a file the time delay between spectrogram updates. Add a script
    to analyze it, called hist.py
+    Add new file "hellogl.py" to experiment with opengl drawing.
+    Save and restore dock and toolbar states on exit and restart, respectively.
+    Allow to modify the time range of the spectrogram.
+    Fix the logic of lost chunks in the timer slot.
+    Make the time range a parameter in the CanvasScaledSpectrogram class.
+    Add a flag to indicate that we are processing the last chunk of the
    timer fire, so that if we are not we do not bother updating the screen.
+    Replace while loop with a for loop, allows to know where we are
    in the process.
+    Store the number of available chunks in a variable instead of
    calling the interface multiple times.
+    Add a statistics entry about mean number of chunks by timer fire,
    in the last 1000 timer fires.
+    Add a latency measurement to the statistics.
+    Add icon for the statistics button in the toolbar. Now we have icons
    for all buttons.

2009/09

+    Add profiling option with console output instead of a file for
    kcachegrind.
+    Add an icon for the spectrum action.
+    Do not update the spectrum when the widget is not visible.
+    Do not compute and update the levels when the widget is not visible.
+    Do not try to display the statistics when the widget is not visible.
+    Do not update the scope widget when it is not visible.
+    Add svg icons for levels and scope widget.
+    Add an icon for the Stop button.
+    New resource svg for the Start button. Also rename the resource
    file to resource_rc.py since it's what Qt Designer asks for.
+    Use QDockWidget::toggleViewAction instead of our own actions with
    signals and slots.
+    Fix FFT size in UI
+    Add a __del__ method for explicit deletion of the spectrogram painter
    and its pixmap. Avoids a segfault.
+    Add a setup.py file with basic commands for py2exe. Allows building
    an exe for Windows.
+    Add resource.py to the versioned-controled files.
+    More fine tuning to the level widget layout. Move it to the left.
+    Fix Level widget layout.
+    Fix minimum size for the qsynthmeter widget.
+    Small adjustment to level widget layout. Needs more work.
+    Remove frame around spectrogram. Fix statusbar.
+    Add tollbar buttons to toggle the display of individual widgets.
+    Move the Start/Stop button to a new toolbar. Move the scope, spectrum,
    level and statistics widgets to dock widgets.
+    Dynamically choose the maximum number of chunks to read by timer
    tick based on the latency reported by portaudio.
+    Handle up to three chunks in a row instead of discarding the additional
    ones.
+    Be a little more verbose for statistics, to be clearer.

2009/08

+    Add a link to the wiki in README
+    Rework the layout of the level meter a little bit.
+    Add peaks to the spectrum widget
+    Derive qsynthMeter from QFrame and give it a raised look
+    Int conversion cleanup
+    Use default for size hints of levels.
+    Change the way audio levels are displayed : put them closer to the
    level widget.
+    Remove the display of the max of the current audio data.
+    Fix the time axis on the spectrogram widget. Now set to 10 seconds
    for every choice of the FFT window length.

2009/07

+    Add a spacer in the first horizontal layout to give a more natural
    size to the buttons.
+    Use only integers in frequency scales.
+    Move buttons at the top of the layout for better alignment of the
    widgets.
+    Use custom labels using 'k' for thousands in frequency scales
    widgets.
+    Switch from seconds to milliseconds in the signal widget.
+    Add pointer info in the status bar when clicking in the signal or
    spectrum widgets.
+    Add pointer info in the status bar when clicking on the rolling spectrogram widget.

2009/06

+    Add statistics about useless timer events
+    Bugfix : forgot to reset the needfullreplot switch
+    Display info about lost chunks of data
+    Fix logarithmic scale in the spectrum plot
+    Fix use of timer and Start button when changing device
+    Factor device test code
+    Print an error message when selecting a non-working input device
+    Non-fatal error on device change
+    Iterate over available devices for a working one
    On startup, first try the default system device, and then the other
+    Bugfix for delays
    
    If the program is too slow to process all the chunks, discard those
    in excess. In fact, it is not that it is too slow, it is probably
    that there is a small mismatch between the timer period and the audio
    buffer period.
+    Major timer-based refactor
    
    All sub-processes have been removed and replaced with a timer in the
    main process. This timer fires every 20 ms or so and retrieves audio
    data. This removes a lot of complexity coming from synchronization
    issues.
    
    Additionnally a level-meter widget is introduced, and the plot widgets
    have been optimized so that only the needed part is redrawn (namely axes
    are not redrawn).

2009/01

+    Add a copy of the GPLv3.
+    Update License statements to GPL version 3.
+    Add proper encoding statements, and License statements.
+    Add details in TODO.
+    Add items and details in TODO.
+    Add a TODO file.
+    "Simplify" locking.
+    Move profiling code to be all conditional.
