# According to the IEC 1260:1995 and the ANSI S1.11:2004 standards, the midband (or center) frequency of the bandpass filter
# is defined by the following equations:
#
#     fi = 1000 * 2ib for 1/N octave filters when N is odd
#
#     fi = 1000 * 2(i+1)b/2 for 1/N octave filters when N is even
#
#     where
#     fi is the center frequency of the ith band-pass filter expressed in hertz.
#     i is an integer when i = 0, f0 = 1 kHz, which is the reference frequency for the audio range.
#     b is the bandwidth designator and equals 1 for octave, 1/3 for 1/3 octave, 1/6 for 1/6 octave, 1/12 for 1/12 octave, and 1/24 for 1/24 octave.
